# machine.ubuntu

These scripts are for setting up a base Ubuntu machine to the way I like it. I try to automate everything, but where I can't I write instructions to follow so I can setup a new machine in minimal time.

# Steps

1. Run the following in a terminal:
    ```
    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berkeleybross/machine.ubuntu/master/bootstap.sh | bash
    ```
